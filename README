Keeping track of IPv4 traffic usage

Data is sourced from vaultaire, and collated into a series
of time histograms (one per IP, per direction).

Once the data is in this form, it is then possible to very
quickly access the exact traffic usage of an IP for any time
period, with a variable granularity defined at query time.


This code is intended to be optimised for high volume throughput
on the input side, and very fast reads on the output side.
